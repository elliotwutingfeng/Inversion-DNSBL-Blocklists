Use of the datasets provided through the OpenINTEL website is subject to the
terms and conditions set out in this document. PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT
CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING OR USING DATA.

0. THE OPENINTEL PROJECT

The OpenINTEL project is a joint project of the University of Twente, SURF,
SIDN Labs and NLnet Labs. More information on the project can be found on our 
website:

1. LICENCE

The open access datasets provided through the OpenINTEL website are subject
to the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence. This licence entitles you to
use, modify and redistribute the data for non-commercial purposes, provided
that redistribution takes place under the same terms, and that you give
appropriate credit to the source of the data, as stipulated under clause 2
below. You can find the licence in full at:

Any redistribution of (parts of) OpenINTEL open access data MUST include an
unmodified copy of this document in full.

2. ATTRIBUTION

If you make use of any of the open access data from the OpenINTEL project,
you must acknowledge use of this data by including the following attribution
in any document, web page or other communication:

"The research leading to these results was made possible by OpenINTEL
(https://www.openintel.nl/), a joint project of the University of
Twente, SIDN, SURF and NLnet Labs."

Furthermore, if you use open access data from the OpenINTEL project for
research that is published in a scientific paper, poster or other peer
reviewed content, you must cite the following paper as describing the
method through which the data has been collected:

van Rijswijk-Deij, R., Jonker, M., Sperotto, A., & Pras, A. (2016). A High-
Performance, Scalable Infrastructure for Large-Scale Active DNS Measurements. 
IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 34(7), pp. 1877-1888.

We keep track of research papers that use data from OpenINTEL on our website,
and would appreciate it if you can notify us of any publications in which you
use our datasets. Please contact r.m.vanrijswijk@utwente.nl and
a.sperotto@utwente.nl, and send us the citation of you paper, and, if possible
a PDF of the paper so we can read it.

3. USE OF THE DOWNLOAD SERVICE

Persons and/or organisations that wish to download data that is made available
by the OpenINTEL project through its public servers must take reasonable
measures to ensure that the project's servers do not experience undue load
because of excessive downloads or automated processes. The OpenINTEL project
reserves the right to block downloads from any location or address without
prior notice. Any abuse will be reported to appropriate abuse contact points.

In general we note that datasets are updated once every 24 hours, thus, down-
loading data more frequently than once per calendar day is generally not
useful.

4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
